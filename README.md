Personal web page hosted by GitHub

Hoping to continually update this as I learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and other relevant web development languages.

<b>Current Version:</b> Basic Resume companion with a more graphic interface. Currently lists 2 ongoing Projects in the Projects Section, and needs to be updated with information regarding work experiences. Need some help on formatting everything correctly though...would like to also make this site a little more dynamic going forward, with tabs for various pages and cure animations. We'll see if I have time for this. Perhaps I will create a link to a portfolio repository?  

Current version powered by W3.CSS
